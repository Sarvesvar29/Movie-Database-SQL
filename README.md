# Movie-Database-SQL
The Movie Database Management System is a beginner-friendly SQL project that manages essential information about movies, genres, actors, and user ratings. It demonstrates the use of relational databases to efficiently organize and retrieve data using SQL commands.

In this project, multiple tables were designed to store structured data:

Genres: to classify movies (e.g., Action, Drama)

Movies: to store movie details like title and release year

Actors: to store actor names

MovieActors: to manage many-to-many relationships between movies and actors

Ratings: to collect user reviews and scores for movies
